## 💡 Key Insights

### What Makes Mercury Special?
- **Hierarchical messaging** for complex UI systems
- **Zero coupling** between components
- **VR/XR optimized** for real-time applications
- **Research validated** (CHI 2018 publication)

### Why These Improvements?
1. Current routing limitations (can't reach siblings/cousins)
2. Performance needed for large-scale (10K+ nodes)
3. Developer experience gaps (debugging, setup)
4. Ecosystem missing (reusable components)

### What's the Main Goal?
**Transform Mercury from research prototype → production-ready framework**
- Used by 1,000+ developers
- Marketplace with reusable components
- Industry-standard for Unity XR messaging
- Additional research publications

## ⚠️ Critical Warnings

### DO NOT:
- ❌ Skip Phase 1 - UIST deadline is non-negotiable
- ❌ Break backward compatibility - existing users depend on Mercury
- ❌ Add features without performance testing - speed is Mercury's advantage
- ❌ Ignore user feedback - community adoption is critical

### DO:
- ✅ Start Phase 1 immediately (UIST deadline approaching)
- ✅ Test performance continuously (< 5% overhead budget)
- ✅ Document all decisions in context file
- ✅ Update task checklist weekly
- ✅ Review plan quarterly and adapt

## 🎓 Academic vs Commercial Context

### If Academic Lab:
- **Timeline:** Extend 50% for student availability
- **Budget:** Reduce 40-60% using student labor
- **Focus:** Phases 1-3 (research contributions)
- **Defer:** Cross-platform ports to future work

### If Commercial Product:
- **Timeline:** Compress with full-time team
- **Budget:** Increase for contractors
- **Focus:** Phases 4-5 (market features)
- **Accelerate:** Community building
