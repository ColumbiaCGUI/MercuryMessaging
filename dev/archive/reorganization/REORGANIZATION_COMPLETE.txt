FILES TRACKED BY GIT
================================================================================

All git-tracked files have been moved with `git mv` to preserve history.
Untracked files (Unity Library files, generated content) remain in old folders.

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS - IMPORTANT!
================================================================================

1. OPEN UNITY
   - Unity needs to process the changes and update references
   - This may take a few minutes depending on project size

2. LET UNITY REIMPORT
   - Wait for Unity to finish reimporting all assets
   - Check console for any errors or warnings

3. OLD FOLDERS CLEANUP
   - After Unity successfully reimports, old empty folders can be safely deleted:
     * Assets/_MK/ (now ThirdParty/Plugins/MKGlowFree/)
     * Assets/ALINE/ (now ThirdParty/Plugins/ALINE/)
     * Assets/MCP/ (now ThirdParty/AssetStore/ModularCityProps/)
     * Assets/NewGraph-master/ (now ThirdParty/GraphSystem/NewGraph/)
     * Assets/Oculus/, MetaXR/, XR/, XRI/ (now in XRConfiguration/)
     * And other moved folders...
   - Unity will show these as empty after reimport

4. TEST PROJECT
   - Open your scenes and verify everything works
   - Test prefabs and scripts
   - Check VR functionality

5. COMMIT CHANGES
   - Review git status
   - Commit the reorganization
   - Push to repository

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

If Unity shows missing references:
1. Close Unity
2. Delete Library/ folder
3. Reopen Unity and wait for complete reimport
4. Check console for remaining issues

If you need help:
- Check REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md for detailed migration guide
- Check README.md files in each major folder
- See claude.md for framework documentation
