        /*
        AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionMixWithOthers --
            This allows an application to set whether or not other active audio apps will be interrupted or mixed with
            when your app's audio session goes active. The typical cases are:
             (1) AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord or AVAudioSessionCategoryMultiRoute
                 this will default to false, but can be set to true. This would allow other applications to play in the background
                 while an app had both audio input and output enabled
             (2) AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback
                 this will default to false, but can be set to true. This would allow other applications to play in the background,
                 but an app will still be able to play regardless of the setting of the ringer switch
             (3) Other categories
                 this defaults to false and cannot be changed (that is, the mix with others setting of these categories
                 cannot be overridden. An application must be prepared for setting this property to fail as behaviour
                 may change in future releases. If an application changes their category, they should reassert the
                 option (it is not sticky across category changes).

        AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionDuckOthers --
            This allows an application to set whether or not other active audio apps will be ducked when when your app's audio
            session goes active. An example of this is the Nike app, which provides periodic updates to its user (it reduces the
            volume of any music currently being played while it provides its status). This defaults to off. Note that the other
            audio will be ducked for as long as the current session is active. You will need to deactivate your audio
            session when you want full volume playback of the other audio.
            If your category is AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback, AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord, or
            AVAudioSessionCategoryMultiRoute, by default the audio session will be non-mixable and non-ducking.
            Setting this option will also make your category mixable with others (AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionMixWithOthers
            will be set).

        AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionAllowBluetooth --
            This allows an application to change the default behaviour of some audio session categories with regards to showing
            bluetooth Hands-Free Profile (HFP) devices as available routes. The current category behavior is:
             (1) AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord
                 this will default to false, but can be set to true. This will allow a paired bluetooth HFP device to show up as
                 an available route for input, while playing through the category-appropriate output
             (2) AVAudioSessionCategoryRecord
                 this will default to false, but can be set to true. This will allow a paired bluetooth HFP device to show up
                 as an available route for input
             (3) Other categories
                 this defaults to false and cannot be changed (that is, enabling bluetooth for input in these categories is
                 not allowed)
                 An application must be prepared for setting this option to fail as behaviour may change in future releases.
                 If an application changes their category or mode, they should reassert the override (it is not sticky
                 across category and mode changes).

        AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionDefaultToSpeaker --
            This allows an application to change the default behaviour of some audio session categories with regards to
            the audio route. The current category behavior is:
             (1) AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord category
                 this will default to false, but can be set to true. this will route to Speaker (instead of Receiver)
                 when no other audio route is connected.
             (2) Other categories
                 this defaults to false and cannot be changed (that is, the default to speaker setting of these
                 categories cannot be overridden
                 An application must be prepared for setting this property to fail as behaviour may change in future releases.
                 If an application changes their category, they should reassert the override (it is not sticky across
                 category and mode changes).

        AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionInterruptSpokenAudioAndMixWithOthers --
            If another app's audio session mode is set to AVAudioSessionModeSpokenAudio (podcast playback in the background for example),
            then that other app's audio will be interrupted when the current application's audio session goes active. An example of this
            is a navigation app that provides navigation prompts to its user (it pauses any spoken audio currently being played while it
            plays the prompt). This defaults to off. Note that the other app's audio will be paused for as long as the current session is
            active. You will need to deactivate your audio session to allow the other audio to resume playback.
            Setting this option will also make your category mixable with others (AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionMixWithOthers
            will be set).  If you want other non-spoken audio apps to duck their audio when your app's session goes active, also set
            AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionDuckOthers.

        AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionAllowBluetoothA2DP --
            This allows an application to change the default behaviour of some audio session categories with regards to showing
            bluetooth Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP), i.e. stereo Bluetooth, devices as available routes. The current
            category behavior is:
            (1) AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord
            this will default to false, but can be set to true. This will allow a paired bluetooth A2DP device to show up as
            an available route for output, while recording through the category-appropriate input
            (2) AVAudioSessionCategoryMultiRoute and AVAudioSessionCategoryRecord
            this will default to false, and cannot be set to true.
            (3) Other categories
            this defaults to true and cannot be changed (that is, bluetooth A2DP ports are always supported in output-only categories).
            An application must be prepared for setting this option to fail as behaviour may change in future releases.
            If an application changes their category or mode, they should reassert the override (it is not sticky
            across category and mode changes).
            Setting both AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionAllowBluetooth and AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionAllowBluetoothA2DP is allowed. In cases
            where a single Bluetooth device supports both HFP and A2DP, the HFP ports will be given a higher priority for routing. For HFP
            and A2DP ports on separate hardware devices, the last-in wins rule applies.

         AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionAllowAirPlay --
            This allows an application to change the default behaviour of some audio session categories with regards to showing
            AirPlay devices as available routes. See the documentation of AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionAllowBluetoothA2DP for details on
            how this option applies to specific categories.
