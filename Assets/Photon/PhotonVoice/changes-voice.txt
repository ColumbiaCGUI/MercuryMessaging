Photon Voice 2 Change Log

v2.55 (February 26, 2024)
   PUN2: v2.45 (PUN2.45) 
   RT/lib: v4.1.8.0
   PhotonVoiceApi: revision 7409
   Unity: 2019.4.39 or higher
   UPDATED: Photon3Unity3D.dll, Photon Realtime (LoadBalancing) to v4.1.8.0
   UPDATED: PUN to v2.45
   ADDED: VisionOS support (Opus and WebRTC Audio libraries)
Core:
   BREAKING: ILogger.Log*() methods replaced with LogLevel enum and single Log() method accepting logging level
   BREAKING: added ILogger.Level property, that Voice code can check to avoid unnecessary Log() methods calls
   ADDED: LogLevel.Trace logging level
   BREAKING: LoadBalancingTransport is no longer ILogger, user code must provide Voice components with ILogger implementation (like Unity.Logger)
   ADDED: LoadBalancingTransport (and VoiceCLient created by the transport) uses private LBCLogger relying on LoadBalancingClient.DebugReturn() if not provided with an external ILogger
FMOD:
   FIXED: FMOD.AudioOutEvent playback (OutPos returns the position not wrapped by the event length)
PS4/PS5:
   CHANGED: Speaker.OutputPlugin property is exposed in Speaker's Editor inspector

v2.54 (January 08, 2024)
   PUN2: v2.43 (PUN2.43)
   RT/lib: v4.1.7.1
   PhotonVoiceApi: revision 7300
   Unity: 2019.4.39 or higher
Unity:
   FIXED: Speaker does not call audioOutput.Push() after stopping even if it receives a decoded packet
   FIXED: added a null-check in ConnectAndJoin.IsConnected that called sometimes before Start() where voiceConnection is initialized
   FIXED: removed SupportClass.StopAllBackgroundCalls() call from VoiceConnection.OnDestroy() (accidentally left after removal of AppQuit handling from VoiceConnection)
   REMOVED: LoadBalancingClient.ClientType update in VoiceConnection since we set it in the transport now
Fusion:
   ADDED: support for Fusion 2
   ADDED: additional security in case the Fusion's runner was not yet connecting during Fusionvoiceclient start
   FIXED: missing AutoConnectAndJoin checkbox in FusionVoiceClient inspector
   CHANGED: VoiceFollowClient.JoinVoiceRoom is virtual protected to allow room join customization
PUN:
   CHANGED: VoiceFollowClient.JoinVoiceRoom is virtual protected to allow room join customization
Core:
   FIXED: Set() was called sometimes on closed RemoteVoice.frameQueueReady AutoResetEvent
   FIXED: LoadBalancingTransport sets LoadBalancingClient.ClientType to Voice
   FIXED: VoiceClient.onVoiceRemove() referenced null in a log message if the voice was not found
   CHANGED: LoadBalancingTransport.LoadBalancingPeer.ChannelCount is set to at least 4 instead of length of Codec enum + 1 (the enum may be large while we normally do no need more than 4 channels)
iOS
   FIXED: AudioIn: routing audio out to earpiece (receiver) instead of loudspeaker since iOS 17 (and earlier versions for new iPad Pro) due to wrong initialization order (regression): session category is now set after AudioUnit creation
   FIXED: audio session 'Game' preset Mode changed to 'VoiceChat' from 'Default' that muted audio out sometimes
   CHANGED: Recorder default iOS Audio Session settings are 'Game' preset
   CHANGED: iOS Audio Session settings to 'Game' preset in all demos 
   NOTE: make sure that Recorder iOS Audio Session Preset is 'Game' in existing projects (it may be 'Custom' with wrong 'Default' mode)
   CHANGED: AudioIn: when stopping recording, session category is set to its previous values instead of Ambient
PS4/PS5:
   FIXED: the locking in PlayStationAudioOut.cs
   ADDED: AudioPluginPhotonVoice which enables support for routing audio output through the Unity Mixer before re-routing it directly to the Sony audioout APIs via a native mixer plugin on the PS4 and PS5
   ADDED: a new public 'OutputPlugin' field for PS4 and PS5 to Speaker.cs, which enables the user to select if he wants to use the classic PhotonVoiceAudioOutputPlugin (which does neither support nor require the use of a mixer) or the new AudioPluginPhotonVoice (which supports, but also requires the use of a mixer)
FMOD:
   FIXED: FMODHelpersMenu.cs was excluded from the project if FMOD was not enabled resulting in missing 'Photon Voice/Enable FMOD Integration' menu
   BREAKING: FMOD.AudioInReader no longer replaces -1 device id with 0 assuming that -1 is Voice API default mic: callers should always pass FMOD-specific device id
DemoVoiceUI:
   ADDED: FMOD microphone input support implemented via Recorder.InputFactory, added internal MicType and made other changes to integrate FMOD mic into the microphone list and differentiate it from AudioTone source, also factory based
   CHNAGED: RemoteSpeakerUI does not require Speaker (for easier manipulations in Editor)
   CHANGED: remote player UserId replaced with NickName + ActorNr in UI

v2.53 (September 06, 2023)
   PUN2: v2.43 (PUN2.43) 
   RT/lib: v4.1.7.1
   PhotonVoiceApi: revision 7141
   Unity: 2019.4.39 or higher
   UPDATED: Photon3Unity3D.dll, Photon Realtime (LoadBalancing) and Chat APIs to v4.1.7.1
   UPDATED: PUN to v2.43
PUN:
   CHANGED: 'following the Leader' logic extracted from PunVoiceClient into abstract VoiceFollowClient class
   ADDED: the voice client goes offline for errors in OpAuthenticate and OpJoinRoom until the next successfull Leader connection
   ADDED: ReconnectAndRejoin functionality: the voice room now has a PlayerTTL of 2 seconds; if the connection is lost, the client will attempt to get back into the room quickly
   CHANGED: if Leader isn't in an online room, the voice client will disconnect and stay offline
   BREAKING: there are other changes due to the rework that may affect the behavior
Fusion:
   BREAKING: FusionVoiceClient implemented via VoiceFollowClient, behavior is consistent with PUN now but can differ from the previous realization
   CHANGED: FusionVoiceClient: if networkRunner.GameMode is Single, Voice client does not connect
WebGL:
   FIXED: WebGL Audio AudioWorkletProcessor canceled processing if the first process() call buffer had no data that might happen during initialization, the remote voice did not play in this case
   ADDED: audio input device enumeration: WebAudioInEnumerator, returns the result asynchronously
   ADDED: audio input device selection: WebAudioMicIn() accepts 'deviceId' parameter
Core:
   CHANGED: VoiceClient.ThreadingEnabled is always false for UNITY_WEBGL, setter is ignored
   ADDED: IDeviceEnumerator.OnReady callback (asynchronous API, required by WebGL): both sync and async implementations call it when the device list is ready
   CHANGED: all DeviceEnumeratorBase inheritors call OnReady when the list is updated
DemoVoiceUI:
   CHANGED: audio input enumeration switched to asynchronous API to support WebGL
   CHANGED: ToneAudioReader is used for tone generator because ToneAudioPusher is not supported on WebGL

v2.52 (May 23, 2023)
   PUN2: v2.42 (PUN2.42) 
   RT/lib: 4.1.6.24
   PhotonVoiceApi: revision 6905
   Unity: 2019.4.39 or higher
   UPDATED: Photon3Unity3D.dll, Photon Realtime (LoadBalancing) and Chat APIs to v4.1.6.24
   UPDATED: PUN to v2.42
VoiceConnection:
   ADDED: 'C++ API Compatibility Mode' checkbox in VoiceConnection editor inspector
Recorder:
   ADDED: TargetPlayers property: only players specified in this property receive the voice info event and stream data, remote players also receive the voice remove event when removed from the list
   FIXED: SetAndroidNativeMicrophoneSettings() did not update anything
   CHANGED: Recorder uses Photon microphone type for WebGLPlayer even if Unity microphone type set
   CHANGED: Recorder uses AndroidAudioInParameters from Voice API directly instead of locally defined proxy struct NativeAndroidMicrophoneSettings
   BREAKING: Android microphone settings field name and type changed, all settings will be reset to true in Editor
   CHANGED: added public getters for Android microphone settings properties
Speaker:
   CHANGED: AudioOutDelayControl delay tolerance reduced (smaller drifts from the target delay)
   CHANGED: Speaker.Lag returns audioOutput.Lag or 0 if audioOutput is null (was -1 if not playing)
   FIXED: SpeakerFMOD editor inspector did not show SpeakerFMOD parameters: added SpeakerFMODEditor extending SpeakerEditor
iOS:
   FIXED: audio capture on iPhone 14: InputCallback is added and used for capture, RenderCallback still exists in the pipeline but does not do anything
Android:
   CHANGED: audio library: all permissions removed from the manifest, user must set permissions correctly in the application manifest
WebGL:
   CHANGED: Platform.CreateAudioInEnumerator() returns an instance of the new DeviceEnumeratorSingleDevice calss with the device named 'Default' instead of AudioInEnumeratorNotSupported for Unity WebGL platform
   CHANGED: Unity.AudioInEnumerator and UnityMicrophone rely on Unity Microphone API in Editor even if the platform is WebGL
Other:
   CHANGED: Unity methods are made protected virtual in UnityVoiceClient, FusionVoiceClient, PunVoiceClient and Speaker to allow component inheritance
   CHANGED: CustomEditor are marked as 'for child classes' in UnityVoiceClientEditor, FusionVoiceClientEditor, PunVoiceClientEditor to allow component inheritance
   BREAKING: VoiceConnection transport creation moved from constructor to Awake(): VoiceConnection.Client can be referenced by other components not earlier than in Start()
   CHANGED: code referencing VoiceConnection.Client moved from Awake() and OnEnabled() to Start() in PunVoiceClient, utility scripts and demos components
   CHANGED: in the above components, code form OnDisable() moved to OnDestroy()
   FIXED: OpusDecoder: IL2CPP-specific attribute is disabled for Unity prior to version 2021 in to avoid compilation error due to Unity bug (the affected method is experimental and unlikely to be used in older versions)
   REMOVED: UnityVoiceClientEditor photon components versions section
Demos:
   CHANGED: demos use Unity.AudioInEnumerator() as a recommended way to enumerate Unity microphones instead of UnityMicrophone.devices
   CHANGED: DemoVoicePun lists both Unity and Photon microphones in the device info
   CHANGED: DelayProcessor attenuates original signal to avoid overload
DemoVoiceUI:
   ADDED: mic intesity bar + color when transmitting
   ADDED: Android native microphone settings to demo ui

v2.51 (February 02, 2023)
   PUN2: v2.41 (PUN2.41) 
   RT/lib:4.1.6.18f2
   PhotonVoiceApi: revision 6697
   Unity: 2019.4.39 or higher
WebGL:
   ADDED: WebGL support via WebAudio API (Unity 2021.2 or higher required)
   NOTE: Safari is not supported
   NOTE: WebGL audio output implementation bypasses Unity audio system and uses WebAudio API context destination directly
   NOTE: Speaker applies AudioSource's volume and spatial blend, object position and AudioListener transform to WebGL audio output instance
   NOTE: WebGL audio output uses optimized audio graph if initialized with spatial blend = 1 or 0. To allow dynamic spatial blend, set AudioSource.spatialBlend to the value between 0 and 1 in Editor or call Speaker.RestartRecording() after changing it in runtime
   NOTE: AudioClipWrapper fails in WebGL after about 40 seconds with "memory access out of bounds" error in Unity AudioClip.GetData()
Recorder:
   FIXED: Recorder ignored voiceDetectionThreshold set in Editor
Android:
   CHANGED: native audio library: switching between audio devices improved, device selection order: bluetooth, usb, wired, speaker
PS4/PS5:
   FIXED: the "Mute Game Voice Chat" option in the PlayStation settings is now handled correctly

v2.50 (October 18, 2022)
   PUN2: v2.41 (PUN2.41) 
   RT/lib:4.1.6.18f2
   PhotonVoiceApi: revision 6358
   Unity: 2019.4.39 or higher (supporting Android x86_64 and UWP ARM64)
Migration Guide:
  - Backup
  - Remove Assets/Photon/PhotonVoice folder
  - Import Voice2 asset
  - Make sure that either a Speaker is attached to the prefab representing a voice (PhotonVoiceView or VoiceNetworkObject) or the Speaker prefab property is set in UnityVoiceClient, PunVoiceClient or FusionVoiceClient
  - Update Speaker Play Delay in Editor if you used non-default Playback Delay Settings
  - Set Recorder.RecordingEnabled to true if Recorder.AutoStart was true before the update
  Fusion:
  - Remove UnityVoiceClient (former VoiceConnection) and make sure that FusionVoiceClient component is attached (it should automatically replace no longer existing FusionVoiceBridge)
  FMOD:
  - Replace Speaker with SpeakerFMOD and remove missing script (no longer existing FMODSpeakerSetup)  
  Code:
  - Rename VoiceConnection -> UnityVoiceClient
  - Rename PhotonVoiceNetwork -> PunVoiceClient
  - Remove Logger.Is*Enabled checks
  - Replace Recorder.IsRecording with RecordingEnabled
  - Replace Recorder.MicrophonesEnumerator with an enumerator created with Platform.CreateAudioInEnumerator() in user code
  - Replace Recorder.UnityMicrophoneDevice and Recorder.PhotonMicrophoneDeviceId with Recorder.MicrophoneDevice
  - Replace Recorder.PlaybackDelayMinSoft with Recorder.PlayDelay and remove occurrences of PlaybackDelayMaxSoft and PlaybackDelayMaxHard
  - Remove all occurrences of GlobalPlaybackDelayMinSoft, GlobalPlaybackDelayMaxSoft, GlobalPlaybackDelayMaxHard, PlaybackDelayMinSoft, PlaybackDelayMaxSoft, PlaybackDelayMaxHard
  - Update other API calls according to the changes list below
  - If the code taken from a Voice2 demo does not compile, see how this demo has changed in the package
PhotonVoiceAPI:
   BREAKING: AudioOutDelayControl<T>.OutPos and FMOD.AudioInEnumerator() signatures changed
   FIXED: the output buffer cleanup procedure called OutWrite(zeroFrame) at least once in each AudioOutDelayControl.Service() call even if OutPos did not change (could be hundreds of times per sec. in Unity because Service() is called in Update())
   FIXED: Unity MicWrapperPusher (using OnAudioFilterRead)
   FIXED: PS4/PS5: Unity MicWrapper/MicWrapperPusher sampling rate selection from the fixed set supported by the platform
   FIXED: OSX native audio input: AudioComponentInstanceDispose is called on audio unit when destroying component: other sounds ducked on capture initialization restore their normal level
   CHANGED: LocalVoiceFramed<T>.PushData() does not skip audio processing and encoding if voiceClient is not connected (set TransmitEnabled to false to skip processing)
   ADDED: LocalVoiceFramedBase.RemoveProcessor()
VoiceConnection:
   CHANGED: VoiceConnection is not instantiated directly, but is a base class for Unity, PUN and Fusion integration implementations: extended class needs to define how to use PrimaryRecorder and SpeakerPrefab
   CHANGED: initialization: a component that owns or creates the Recorder (PUN.PhotonVoiceView or Fusion.VoiceNetworkObject or VoiceConnection instance itself owning PrimaryRecorder) calls VoiceConnection.AddRecorder() to register and initialize the Recorder
   BREAKING: removed VoiceConnection.AutoCreateSpeakerIfNotFound, VoiceConnection does not create Speaker if it's not specified: SpeakerPrefab must be set for Speaker creation
   BREAKING: removed SpeakerFactory, use SpeakerPrefab with proper Speaker implementation
   ADDED: VoiceConnectionClient.UsePrimaryRecorder property (PUN and Fusion integrations start PrimaryRecorder directly if true)
UnityVoiceClient:
   CHANGED: UnityVoiceClient is a Unity integration extending VoiceConnection, it uses PrimaryRecorder for outgoing stream and instantiates Speakers from SpeakerPrefab
   CHANGED: ignores UsePrimaryRecorder and always starts PrimaryRecorder as before
   CHANGED: UnityVoiceClientEditor does not hide app settings when client is connected
   ADDED: application settings can be optionally read from VoiceAppSettings scriptable object available in Editor
PUN:
   BREAKING: renamed PhotonVoiceNetwork -> PunVoiceClient
   CHANGED: PunVoiceClient creates Recorder only if photonView.IsMine and always creates Speaker
   ADDED: PrimaryRecorder started directly if VoiceConnection.UsePrimaryRecorder is set (PhotonVoiceView prefab is not required)
   ADDED: SpeakerPrefab instantiated directly on PunVoiceClient object if userData is null (remote voice of PrimaryRecorder started directly)
   REMOVED: PunVoiceClient.WorkInOfflineMode: Voice does not support offline mode   
   REMOVED: PhotonVoiceView.UsePrimaryRecorder: PrimaryRecorder is used automatically if the Recorder is not found in PhotonVoiceView object hierarchy
   CHANGED: PhotonVoiceView Speaker initialization: either the Speaker found in the object hierarchy or PunVoiceClient.SpeakerPrefab is used
   ADDED: PunVoiceClient.UsePunAppSettings public property (this setting was only available in editor)
   BREAKING: removed PhotonVoiceView serialized 'speakerInUse' and 'recorderInUse': it's no longer possible to specify Recorder and Speaker via direct reference in Editor
   BREAKING: removed PhotonVoiceView.RecorderInUse and SpeakerInUse public setters: it's not longer possible to set Recorder and Speaker in runtime
   BREAKING: removed PhotonVoiceView.AutoCreateRecorderIfNotFound (Recorders never created automatically)
   BREAKING: removed PhotonVoiceView.SetupDebugSpeaker: Speaker is always created if specified
   BREAKING: removed PhotonVoiceView.IsSetup
   BREAKING: removed PhotonVoiceView.IsSpeaker, use this.SpeakerInUse != null
   BREAKING: removed PhotonVoiceView.IsRecorder, use this.RecorderInUse != null
   BREAKING: removed PhotonVoiceView.IsSpeakerLinked, use this.SpeakerInUse.IsLinked
   BREAKING: removed PhotonVoiceView.IsPhotonViewReady, assuming always ready
Fusion:
   REMOVED: FusionVoiceBridge referenced VoiceConnection
   ADDED: FusionVoiceClient extending VoiceConnection
   NOTE: remove existing UnityVoiceClient (former VoiceConnection) and make sure that FusionVoiceClient component is attached (it should automatically replace no longer existing FusionVoiceBridge)
   ADDED: PrimaryRecorder started directly if VoiceConnection.UsePrimaryRecorder is set (VoiceNetworkObject prefab is not required)
   ADDED: SpeakerPrefab instantiated directly on FusionVoiceClient object if userData is null (remote voice of PrimaryRecorder started directly)
   CHANGED: VoiceNetworkObject Speaker initialization: either the Speaker found in the object hierarchy or specified FusionVoiceClient.SpeakerPrefab is used
   BREAKING: removed VoiceNetworkObject serialized 'speakerInUse' and 'recorderInUse': it's no longer possible to specify Recorder and Speaker via direct reference in Editor
   BREAKING: removed VoiceNetworkObject.RecorderInUse and SpeakerInUse public setters: it's not longer possible to set Recorder and Speaker in runtime
   BREAKING: removed VoiceNetworkObject.AutoCreateRecorderIfNotFound (Recorders never created automatically)
   BREAKING: removed VoiceNetworkObject.SetupDebugSpeaker: Speaker is always created if specified
   BREAKING: removed VoiceNetworkObject.IsSetup
   BREAKING: removed VoiceNetworkObject.IsSpeaker, use this.SpeakerInUse != null
   BREAKING: removed VoiceNetworkObject.IsRecorder, use this.RecorderInUse != null
   BREAKING: removed VoiceNetworkObject.IsSpeakerLinked, use this.SpeakerInUse.IsLinked
   BREAKING: VoiceNetworkObject Recorder initialization: either PrimaryRecorder or attached Recorder is used without falling back to the latter if UsePrimaryRecorder is true but PrimaryRecorder is not set
   REMOVED: Fusion 0-Minimal demo, it's almost the same as 1-SpeakerPrefab demo but relies on automatic Speaker creation which is no longer supported
Recorder:
   ADDED: Recorder.RecordingEnabled, controls recording state on start and while Recorder is running, exposed in Editor, default is true
   BREAKING: removed Recorder.IsRecording, use RecordingEnabled instead
   BREAKING: removed Recorder.AutoStart, use RecordingEnabled instead
   BREAKING: removed Recorder.StartRecording/StopRecording, use RecordingEnabled instead
   BREAKING: removed Recorder.RequiresRestart, obsolete RequiresInit obsolete ReInit()
   BREAKING: removed 'force' parameter of Recorder.RestartRecording()
   CHANGED: Recorder.RestartRecording() restarts only if RecordingEnabled is true
   CHANGED: Recorder.RestartRecording() returns RecordingEnabled value for convenience
   CHANGED: Recorder.TransmitEnabled is true by default
   BREAKING: renamed Recorder.RecordOnlyWhenJoined to RecordWhenJoined, it updates RecordingEnabled property only when joining or leaving the room, it's still possible to record outside the room, the setter does not tries to start or stop the Recorder
   BREAKING: removed Recorder.RecordOnlyWhenEnabled, 'enable' state is not processed (OnEnable/OnDisable removed): since Update() restarts the Recorder, restart won't work while disabled
   BREAKING: MicrophonePermission helper starts associated Recorder instead of manipulating with its AutoStart property which is no longer available
   REMOVED: RestartRecording button in RecorderEditor.OnInspectorGUI
   BREAKING: removed Recorder.IsInitialized
   BREAKING: removed Recorder.Init (made private)
   BREAKING: removed Recorder.MicrophonesEnumerator, it does not affect Recorder behavior (except checks removed below): create device enumeration instances in user code if necessary
   BREAKING: removed Recorder.UnityMicrophoneDevice
   BREAKING: removed Recorder.PhotonMicrophoneDeviceId
   BREAKING: removed (WSA) Recorder.PhotonMicrophoneDeviceIdString
   BREAKING: removed obsolete Recorder.PhotonMicrophoneEnumerator
   BREAKING: removed deprecated Recorder.ReactOnSystemChanges (use AudioChangesHandler instead)
   BREAKING: removed Recorder.IsDefaultUnityMic()
   BREAKING: removed Recorder.TrySamplingRateMatch and sampling rate matching logic
   CHANGED: 3 platform-specific device ids properties and manipulations over them are replaced with uniform single DeviceInfo exposed in existing MicrophoneDevice property
   REMOVED: IsValidUnityMic() and CheckIfThereIsAtLeastOneMic() checks based on microphone list which is no longer available in Recorder, local voice creation should fail gracefully w/o these checks
   CHANGED: the same IDeviceEnumerator instance is used for Photon and Unity microphones types, GetMicrophonesEnumerator() code moved to MicrophonesEnumerator getter and refactored
   CHANGED: if Recorder.SourceType is Factory and InputFactory is not set, it's assigned with ToneAudioReader() factory automatically
   REMOVED: obsolete SampleTypeConv enum and TypeConvert property
   REMOVED: obsolete Recorder.AudioGroup
   FIXED: updating voiceDetectionDelayMs and voiceDetection with values from VoiceDetector overrode deserialized values (GetActivityDelayFromDetector and GetStatusFromDetector removed)
Recorder Editor:
   REMOVED: microphones list (with enumerators and AudioSettings.OnAudioConfigurationChanged handling)
   REMOVED: 'Enabled WebRtcAudioDsp component' button
   ADDED: 'Remove WebRtcAudioDsp component' button available if the component is present
   ADDED: 'Remove AudioChangesHandler component' button available if the component is present
   CHANGED: iOS and Android specific session parameters and APIs are present on all platforms
   CHANGED: iOS and Android settings are visible regardless of Recorder MicrophoneType
   CHANGED: iOS audio session presets and custom settings handlinging Editor (Recorder stores the preset for use in Editor only; in runtime, only iosAudioSessionParameters are used)
   CHANGED: RecorderEditor no longer hides fields 'non-relevant' to the currently selected SourceType
   CHANGED: Recorder.DebugEcho is always visible in Editor regardless of InterestGroup
   CHANGED: WebRtcAudioDsp control is available on all platforms even if the component is not supported
AudioChangesHandler:
   REMOVED: HandleConfigChange and AudioSettings.GetConfiguration() change detection: it does not make sense because this configuration is for output and its change can't be triggered by microphone configuration change
   NOTE: AudioSettings.OnAudioConfigurationChanged handling is preserved even though it's not triggered by microphone configuration change according to the documentation
   REMOVED: StartWhenDeviceChange, set Recorder.RecordingEnabled to true instead
   REMOVED: UseNativePluginChangeNotifier and UseOnAudioConfigurationChanged: Photon AudioInChangeNotifier used if supported by the platform, otherwise Unity's AudioSettings.OnAudioConfigurationChanged handled
   CHANGED: removed iOS_AlwaysHandleDeviceChange and Android_AlwaysHandleDeviceChange with confusing semantics and replaced with HandleDeviceChangeIOS and HandleDeviceChangeAndroid overriding HandleDeviceChange for correspondent platforms
Speaker:
   BREAKING: removed VoiceConnection.globalPlaybackDelaySettings
   BREAKING: removed PlaybackOnlyWhenEnabled
   BREAKING: removed PlaybackDelayMinSoft, PlaybackDelayMaxSoft, PlaybackDelayMaxHard
   BREAKING: removed Speaker.SetPlaybackDelaySettings() methods
   BREAKING: removed obsolete PlayDelayMs
   BREAKING: removed PlaybackDelaySettings wrapper, Speaker uses AudioOutDelayControl.PlayDelayConfig directly   
   ADDED: PlayDelayConfig getter and setter
   ADDED: PlayDelay getter and setter: updates PlayDelayConfig based on the single given value (simplified API)
   CHANGED: Editor exposes single Speaker.PlayDelay value instead of 3 values of PlayDelayConfig
   CHANGED: play delay settings are never checked but passed as is to AudioOut which corrects them if necessary
   BREAKING: removed Actor property, use RemoteVoice.PlayerId instead
   BREAKING: removed PlaybackStarted
   BREAKING: removed StartPlayback() and StopPlayback() (hopefully used only internally)
   BREAKING: RestartPlayback() does not accept 'reinit' parameter, it always stops and starts audioOutput
   BREAKING: USE_ONAUDIOFILTERREAD conditional compilation replaced with SpeakerAudioFilterRead extending Speaker
   BREAKING: removed AudioOutFactory and GlobalAudioOutFactory
   ADDED: RestartOnDeviceChange property: if true (default), the Speaker is restarted in AudioSettings.OnAudioConfigurationChanged handler (FIXED: 'AudioClip.SetData failed; AudioClip UnityAudioOut contains no data' errors after output device change like when switching to bluetooth on Android)
WebRTCAudioDsp:
   ADDED: missing AgcTargetLevel property
   ADDED: IsSupported property
   BREAKING: removed ForceNormalAecInMobile, proc.AECMobile set if Application.isMobilePlatform is true
   BREAKING: removed AutoRestartOnAudioChannelsMismatch, never restarts on channel count mismatch in OnAudioOutFrameFloat, OnAudioConfigurationChanged should handle this change
   REMOVED: obsolete and not used AECMobile
   REMOVED: obsolete and not used AECMobileComfortNoise
   CHANGED: NoiseSuppression is true by default
   CHANGED: all controls are always visible in WebRTCAudioDspEditor
MicAmplifier:
   FIXED: AmplificationFactor was cast to short for MicAmplifierShort, allowing only integer factors
   REMOVED: BoostValue which only added harmful constant offset to the audio signal
   REMOVED: unused MaxBefore and MaxAfter
FMOD:
   BREAKING: Speaker's companion FMODSpeakerSetup replaced with SpeakerFMOD extending Speaker
   BREAKING: removed FMODRecorderSetup.MicrophoneDevice, FMODMicrophoneDeviceId: Recorder MicrophoneDevice is used instead
   BREAKING: FMODRecorderSetup.autoRestartOnChange serialized field, always restarting if FMODMicrophoneDeviceId property has changed
   REMOVED: microphones list from FMODRecorderSetupEditor
DemoVoiceUI: 
   CHANGED: Unity type microphones are processed consistently with Photon type, via enumerator
   CHANGED: no more special processing for WSA platform microphones
   CHANGED: the demo relies on its own IDeviceEnumerator instances
   CHANGED: menu items hold only Recorder.MicType and DeviceInfo that significantly simplified exchange between menu and Recorder MicrophoneType/MicrophoneDevice
   CHANGED: Unity and Photon default microphones added to the dropdown
   ADDED: AGC Target level slider
Logging:
   CHANGED: single global logging level applies to all voice components, it's exposed by VoiceConnection instance (UnityVoiceClient, PunVoiceClient, FusionVoiceClient) in Editor
   NOTE: global logging level is stored in VoiceLogger object at the root of the scene, different levels can still be applied: a Voicelogger component added to the object sets logging level for voice components attached to this object and all its descendants
   BREAKING: removed ILoggable (LogLevel, Logger), ILoggableDependent (IgnoreGlobalLogLevel)
   BREAKING: removed VoiceComponent.Logger, LogLevel, IgnoreGlobalLogLevel
Other:
   BREAKING: removed VoiceLogger.IsErrorEnabled, IsWarningEnabled, IsInfoEnabled and IsDebugEnabled used mostly for redundant logging level checks, such checks pollute sources and usually don't improve the performance, use VoiceLogger.LogLevel if the check is certainly necessary
   BREAKING: removed VoiceComponent.CurrentPlatform, use Application.platform instead
   REMOVED: PUN, PhotonRealtime and PhotonChat demos
   CHANGED: simple WaveWriter (used in SaveOutgoingStreamToFile and SaveIncomingStreamToFile) extracted from CSCore library and placed in Code/UtilityScripts
   REMOVED: CSCore library
   FIXED: SaveOutgoingStreamToFile uses AddPostProcessor() instead of AddPreProcessor(), otherwise the stream in Process() mismatches VoiceInfo in PhotonVoiceCreated
   BREAKING: removed placeholders for deleted files
   ADDED: RecorderPreset component overriding Recorder (Microphone Type, DSP Enabled) and WebRtcAudioDsp (AEC, VAD) settings per platform

   PhotonVoiceApi: revision 6306
   FIXED: NullReferenceException when Recorder.StopRecordingWhenPaused is enabled as Recorder.HandleApplicationPause was trying to start recording without checking if it should.
   FIXED: [WebRtcAudioDsp.AEC] NullReferenceException when WebRtcAudioDsp.AEC is enabled (introduced in previous version where we subscribe to AudioOutCapture event before we initialize AEC in WebRTCAudioProcessor).
   FIXED: [iOS] resets audio session category to defaults values (CategoryAmbient, ModeDefault, CategoryOptionMixWithOthers) on cleanup (so you can set volume to zero for instance when app is closed).
   FIXED: VoiceConnection.OnRemoteVoiceInfo() was setting the output handler for the remote stream even if the codec was not Opus, this prevented video component sharing this connection from handling the stream.
   ADDED: [Logging] voice networking client's operation response errors (e.g. when join voice room fails).
   ADDED: [WebRtcAudioDsp.AEC] WebRtcAudioDsp.AecOnlyWhenEnabled: as the name implies AEC will be used only when component isActiveAndEnabled (default true).
   CHANGED: [WebRtcAudioDsp.AEC] refactoring started in previous version should be done.

   CHANGED: Recorder.AutoStart will cause recording to start if set to true and conditions are met.
   FIXED: warning due to auto start recording attempt when it's not expected.
   CHANGED: Speaker playback is now handled via Service calls inside VoiceConnection.Update for linked speakers only. (used to be via coroutine inside Speaker itself) This fixes playback when Speaker is not enabled or not active in the hierarchy and Speaker.PlaybackOnlyWhenEnabled is false.
   FIXED: inverted condition in Speaker.StartPlaying which could cause playback to not start.
   ADDED: [MAJOR CHANGE] Recorder.RecordOnlyWhenJoined and all necessary code. Default is true. The recorder's AutoStart will be 'delayed' so PUN integration (PhotonVoiceView has time to set recorder.UserData) and permission request work properly.
