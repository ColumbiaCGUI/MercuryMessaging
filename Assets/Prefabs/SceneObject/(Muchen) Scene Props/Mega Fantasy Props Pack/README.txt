1. This package has many seamless materials and some basic shapes. You can combine a few prefabs or standard models to make more advanced look.
2. Try to make groups of prefabs for future use. Check folder /Mega Fantasy Props Pack/Prefabs/Complex prefabs for examples. It could speed your workflow on making a scene.
